## Files in this repository

File Name | Description
------------ | -------------
run_analysis.R | This file contains a function named run_analysis. This function does not take any arguments. Assumes that you already installed and loaded the plyr and dplyr libraries. The script must be executed in the directory where the dataset is unzipped. For example: I unzipped the dataset on my mac in my home folder i.e. /Users/andaluri. Essentially, the absolute path for the data files would be /Users/andaluri/UCI HAR Dataset. Further I ran the run_analysis function by first sourcing it and then running the function on the command line of R Studio.
codebook.md | This file contains details on how the tidied dataset looks like along with specific details on the columns along with data type.
tidy_data.txt | Copy of the tidy_data.txt that was submitted for grading. This is in addition to the github submission made as part of the assignment. This is a convenience copy to help you see the data quickly (if needed).

Note:
The original data is from a research study ( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones ) that can be found here : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
